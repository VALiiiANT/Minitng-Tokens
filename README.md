# Minting Tokens

This project consists of a demo Smart Contract that is made using Solidity programming language. The program showcases the use cases of basics concepts of Solidity programming language. 



## Description

Written in Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum network, this is a simple contract. The contract enables a user (or a sender) to create, mint and burn tokens.
It has functions to both mint and burn tokens via user's choice. It maintains the total supply of the tokens as well as the balance for each user. Each user is identified by their account address.
The program simply demonstrates the use of basic concepts of Solidity programming language such as Data Types, Mapping, Functions and Conditional Statements.
## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 or compatible.
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle) for deployment and interaction.

#### Deployment
    1. Clone this repository or download the Solidity contract file (token.sol) to your local development environment.
    2. Open the Solidity contract file in your preferred Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle).
    3. Compile the contract to ensure there are no syntax errors or warnings.
    4. Select the desired Ethereum network in your development environment.
    5. Deploy the smart contract.


#### Interacting with the Contract
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the following methods:

    1. Copy the address that your IDE provides (in Remix, Account Address is provided in the left navigation pane under deployment section). 
    2. Enter the address and number of tokens in the mint function to mint tokens. 
    3. Check the updated supply of tokens and your balance. 

Similarly, you can interact  with the burn function. You can further interact by using different addresses, representing different users, each having separate account for transaction.
